# Greenhouse Sensor Simulation

A prototype Python application for simulating and visualising greenhouse sensor data through a simple web interface.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end sensor data pipeline, from simulated data capture to processing and visual display. It is designed as a teaching and prototyping tool rather than a production monitoring system.

## Key Features
- Simulated sensor data generation
- Live data capture and processing
- Simple web interface for visualisation
- Clear separation between data logic and presentation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- HTML / CSS
- Basic data processing utilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+

### Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
